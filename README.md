# mfd_hab_classification

Repo for the classification of the MFD Ontology habitats in the [Microflora Danica](https://github.com/cmc-aau/mfd_wiki/wiki) project and reproduces the results from "Section IV: Convergence of supervised and unsupervised habitat descriptors" of the [MFD manuscripts](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.27.600767v1).

Please download the input data from the [Zenodo repo](https://zenodo.org/records/12605769) in the `/data` folder and amend the `/config/hab_class.yaml` file as indicated.

The script is meant to run with a SLURM system and requires mamba and conda but installs all the other required packages via mamba. The precise partition names or the resource requirements might need to be adjusted in `config/config.yaml` and in the `.rule` files in `scripts/scripts_python/rules/`.
It will aslo try to detect automatically the location where it is. If this fails please amend the file `scripts/scripts_bash/hab_class.sh` as indicated there.


The results from the paper can be reproduced by running:
```
sbatch scripts/scripts_bash/hab_class.sh
```

The results will be collected in the `/analysis` folder.


## Figures

The figures related to the habitat classification are generated by the following scripts:
- '/scripts/scripts_R/tree_pr_auc_classes.Rmd' generates Figure 3;
- '/scripts/scripts_R/FN_analysis.Rmd' generates Supplementary Note Figure 1b.

The input of these figure-generating scripts are some of the files generated by the first one, they location where to find them is controlled by the "data.path" variable.
